# DataStructures.py
# Just being used to help me understand list and dictionaries better.

a = [1,2,3]
print(a)

# List Slicing
b = [1,2,3,4,5]
c = b[:2] # This takes the first 2 elements.
print(c) 

d = b[0:6:2] # In this case we have [Start:End:Spacing] we can also leave Start and End blank if we're using 0th and last element in list.
print(d)

myList = list(range(100)) # Different way of initialising a list.
print(myList[::10])

# List Modifications

## Append, Insert, Remove, Pop, Equiv vs. Copy.

a = [3,6,9]
a.append(12)
print(f"{a[0:3:1]} --> {a} with a.append(12)")

a.insert(3, 'hiya just added') # So position to insert, then content that you're adding.
print(a)

# Sets
setA = {'a','b','c'}
print(setA)

# List to Set to List
a = ['a','a','b','c','c','c']
print(a)
a = list(set(a))
print(a) # Do keep in mind that Sets do not preserve order, so these can end up in random order.
# You can also not access set my position as sets are unordered, you instead access by element.

setA.add('d') # Like insert/append but doesn't add anywhere specific.
print(setA)

# Checking whether something is present in set.
print('a' in setA)
# Returns as a boolean value.
print('z' in setA)
print(len(setA))
setA.pop() # For some reason you can pop, although it just removes a random one ðŸ˜‚.
setA = {'a','b','c'}
setA.discard('a') # Remove a specific value, if not present just does nothing.
print(setA)


# Tuples
# Tuples are immutable unlike the other data structures, they are often returned by default for example when you write return a,b at the bottom of a function.
myTuple = (5,6,7)
print(myTuple)

# Dictionaries
people = {
    'a' : 'Adam',
    'b' : 'Beta',
    'c' : 'Charlie',
}
print(people)
print(people['a'])

people['g'] = 'Goodwin'
print(people['g'])

# Lists within Dictionaries
people = {
    'a':['adam'],
    'b':['Barry', 'Bob'],
        }


people['a'].append('Aaaaaahhh')
print(people['a'])

if 'x' not in people:
    people['x'] = []
people['x'].append('Xavier')
print(people['x'])

'''from collections import defaultlist

people = defaultdict(list)
people['x'].append('Xavier')
print(people)
'''

# print(people['y']) this only works if the above default list is used, this can be used to avoid a lot of null errors initially
# , however they may occur further down the line if error handling is not done correctly.
